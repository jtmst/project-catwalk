# Project Catwalk - Retail Web Portal

This project was build out by 3 developers over the course of two weeks.  The app is built to the specifications of a 24 page business requirement document.  The primary technologies used are React (with React Hooks and custom styled components), with Express to render data from a headless API, Material UI for certain components, and CSS for general styling and custom component design.
